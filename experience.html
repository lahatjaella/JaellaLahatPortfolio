                <p class="text-center" id="experience-statement">As a Patient Care Coordinator and Dental Assistant at Lorton Valley Dental, I was integral to both the administrative and clinical operations of the practice. I expertly managed patient accounts, ensuring the precise handling of insurance, medical, and financial information in full compliance with HIPAA regulations. My role involved scheduling a diverse array of appointmentsâ€”from preventative to complex restorative and orthodontic treatmentsâ€”while addressing patient concerns, obtaining procedure authorizations, and overseeing pre-visit preparations and billing processes. I maintained clear, compassionate communication with patients, guiding them through treatment plans, cost breakdowns, insurance coverage, and payment options to ensure transparency and trust. My proficiency in verifying insurance eligibility, calculating copay estimates, and determining benefits streamlined the financial aspect of care. Clinically, I supported the doctor by meticulously preparing procedure trays, sterilizing instruments, disinfecting operatories, and ensuring patient readiness, contributing to a smooth and efficient treatment experience. My ability to seamlessly balance patient care coordination with hands-on dental assistance underscored my commitment to providing exceptional care and operational excellence.</p>
