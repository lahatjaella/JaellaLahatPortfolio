          <p class="text-center" id="experience-statement">As a College Ambassador and Service Coordinator for the PUSO Foundation (Purposeful Unconditional Service to Others), an international nonprofit focused on providing hope and support to underserved communities, I played a key role in managing local community service projects and fundraising initiatives at VCU.

I was responsible for overseeing event logistics, delegating tasks, and ensuring that all resources were in place for successful execution. In addition to these hands-on initiatives, I actively promoted the PUSO Foundation’s mission—providing hope with a purpose—by representing the organization at campus events, engaging students through digital media, and facilitating tabling sessions to raise awareness. My responsibilities extended to attending monthly ambassador meetings and collaborating with teams in both the U.S. and the Philippines, allowing me to contribute to strategic discussions on expanding the foundation's outreach. Through this role, I developed strong skills in event planning, leadership, team coordination, and communication, while helping to amplify PUSO’s global impact by connecting with diverse communities and supporting meaningful service efforts.</p>
